# travelPath
* This is an interactive Travel Plan web application which is made by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to find least time travel path between source and destination.
* This application demonstrates the use of Graphs in finding the least distance between different locations.
* It is made using the concept of Graphs (Dijkstra algorithm). 
* Available Bus and flight services are used to find the least time travel path.


Following are the snippets of the web application:
* Starting page showing a graph on the left side and instructions on the right side. 'Get New Problem' will generate a new graph.
